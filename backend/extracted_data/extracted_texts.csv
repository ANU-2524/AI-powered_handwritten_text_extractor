public int calculateArea()

5/5

If we create another object Rectangle r2 = new Rectangle(7, 3);, how are the length and width of r1 related to r2?

r2's length and width will overwrite r1's.

Each object (r1 and r2) has its own
independent length and width values.

Changing r1.length will also change r2.length.

They share the same length and width values.
